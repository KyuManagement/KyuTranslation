# KyuTranslation

Help KyuBot learn more languages! We currently support a few languages but our goal is to support every possible language. The current Discord platform languages are available using the following link https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#locales.

## Want to help us?

Just create a new **pull request**! We always appreciate the help from kind people. You don't need to finish the whole translation, our current system is setup to replace any missing translations with English, you can change a single line or do the whole thing. We appreciate the help!
